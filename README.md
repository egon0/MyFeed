# MyFeed

You can now have your own news feed (like a facebook profile) on your own domain/webserver. Put links, images and text into a text field, let the app parse everything nicely for you and get a nice looking web feed for your audience. You can follow other peoples domains and get their content into your own stream. (demo on my own domain [http://robert-agthe.de](http://robert-agthe.de))

# install on [uberspace.de](https://uberspace.de/)
Use "uberspace_install.sh" via shell. This downloads the software into ~/MyFeed/, installs every npm/bower module, creates an .env with your data and setup a new service via daemon tools. It creates also a .htaccess in ~/html/ to redirect every apache request to the nodejs service. The Install script asks for your desired port, username, pw, email and so forth.

# generic install
