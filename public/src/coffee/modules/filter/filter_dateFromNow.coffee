# Angular Foo
# Since Angular infers the controller's dependencies from the 
# names of arguments to the controller's constructor function, 
# if you were to minify the JavaScript code for PhoneListCtrl 
# controller, all of its function arguments would be minified 
# as well, and the dependency injector would not be able to 
# identify services correctly.
